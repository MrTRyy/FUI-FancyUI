# FancyPopover Component

The `FancyPopover` component is a flexible and easy-to-use popover that can be attached to any element. It allows you to display additional information or interactive content in a floating panel that is anchored to a reference element (the `refComponent`). The popover is smartly positioned based on the available viewport space to ensure that it never goes off-screen.

## Props

- `refComponent`: React.ReactElement - The reference component that the popover will be attached to.
- `contentComponent`: React.ReactElement - The content to display inside the popover.
- `offsetX`: number (optional) - The horizontal offset from the reference component. Default is `0`.
- `offsetY`: number (optional) - The vertical offset from the reference component. Default is `0`.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `FancyPopover`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import FancyPopover from 'path-to-FancyPopover';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <FancyPopover
        refComponent={<button>Hover over me</button>}
        contentComponent={<div>This is the popover content!</div>}
        offsetX={10}
        offsetY={15}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the example above, when the button is clicked, the popover content will appear with a 10-pixel offset from the left or right edge (depending on screen position) and a 15-pixel offset from the bottom of the button.

## Accessibility

Ensure to manage focus appropriately when the popover is opened and closed, and consider adding `aria-` attributes for screen reader support.
