## FancySwipeUpModal Documentation

### Overview

The FancySwipeUpModal is a responsive modal component that integrates seamlessly with the fancyportal. It is a highly customizable component that offers a variety of features, making it a versatile solution for displaying modal content in your application.

### Integration Steps

1. Connect the modal to the DOM

Use the `appendToDomID` prop of the FancySwipeUpModal component to specify the DOM element to which the modal should be appended. For example, if you set `appendToDomID` to `modal`, the modal will be appended to the DOM element with the ID `modal`. If you do not provide this prop, the modal will be appended to the body by default. However, it is recommended to always provide an ID for precise placement.

2. Set Modal Open State and Handle Closure

The FancySwipeUpModal relies on two vital props: `isOpen` and `onClose`.

* `isOpen`: This prop uses a state variable, such as `isVisible`, to denote the modal's display status.
* `onClose`: This prop accepts a callback function that is executed when the modal closes on its own accord.

### Additional Features

The FancySwipeUpModal also accepts the following props:

* `children`: Use this prop to pass the child elements you'd like to display inside the modal.
* `isCloseAble`: A boolean prop that indicates if the modal can be closed by the user. When set to `false`, the modal's closure is controlled solely by the state.
* `isScalable`: Another boolean prop determining if the user can scale the modal's height.
* `themeType`: This prop takes different theme values, enabling you to tweak the modal's appearance according to your preference.
* `layer`: It sets the depth of the theme color.

### Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the FancySwipeUpModal component:

```React
import FancySwipeUpModal from '@fancyportal/react-modal';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

  const handleCloseModal = () => {
    setIsVisible(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsVisible(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      <FancySwipeUpModal
        appendToDomID="modal"
        isOpen={isVisible}
        onClose={handleCloseModal}
        children={<div>This is the modal content.</div>}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we use a state variable called `isVisible` to manage the modal's visibility. We also define a callback function called `handleCloseModal` to set `isVisible` to `false` when the modal is closed.

We then pass these props to the `FancySwipeUpModal` component, along with the child elements that we want to display inside the modal.

### Customization

The FancySwipeUpModal component offers a variety of customization options. You can use the `themeType` prop to change the modal's appearance, the `layer` prop to set its depth, and the `isCloseAble` and `isScalable` props to control its behavior.

You can also use CSS to style the modal to your liking. For example, you can change the modal's background color, font size, and border radius.

### Conclusion

The FancySwipeUpModal is a powerful modal component that offers a variety of features and customization options. It is a great choice for displaying modal content in your application.
