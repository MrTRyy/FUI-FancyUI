## FancyCodeVerificationInput Documentation

### Overview

The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` is a sophisticated input component tailored for single-input entries, such as verification codes. Offering an enhanced user experience, it not only transitions automatically to the subsequent input after a key press but also supports copy-paste functionality via `Ctrl + V`. Upon completing the code entry, the handler is activated, returning the entered value and its status, thus making it versatile and useful for various applications requiring code verification.

### Integration Steps

1. **Connect the Component to your Application**

   Import the component using the following:

   ```import FancyCodeVerificationInput from './FancyCodeVerificationInput';```

2. **Initialize and Handle Input State**

   The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` relies on properties such as `isSuccess` and `errorMessage` to manage its internal state. It's essential to set up handlers to determine input success and display potential error messages.

### Additional Features

The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` component accepts several props to enhance its functionality:

- **handler**: Callback function invoked with the input value.
- **length**: Determines the total number of input fields, defaulting to 6.
- **automaticCase**: Determines whether input should be automatically converted to uppercase, lowercase, or remain unchanged.
- **debounceTime**: Provides a debounced input experience with a delay in milliseconds before the handler is called.
- **isSuccess**: Denotes whether the current input is successful.
- **errorMessage**: Allows for displaying custom error messages.

### Example Usage

To best demonstrate the component's functionality, here's a simplified usage:

```React
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import FancyCodeVerificationInput from './FancyCodeVerificationInput';

const MyVerificationComponent = () => {
    const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);
    const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');

    const handleVerification = (value) => {
        if (value === '123456') {
            setIsSuccess(true);
            setErrorMessage('');
        } else {
            setIsSuccess(false);
            setErrorMessage('Incorrect code');
        }
    };

    return (
        <FancyCodeVerificationInput
            length={6}
            handler={handleVerification}
            isSuccess={isSuccess}
            errorMessage={errorMessage}
        />
    );
};

export default MyVerificationComponent;
```

In this example, the `handleVerification` function checks if the entered code matches '123456'. Depending on the match, the input's success status and potential error message are updated.

### Customization

The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` component offers a wide range of customization options. Props such as `length`, `automaticCase`, and `debounceTime` allow you to adjust the input's behavior and appearance. Furthermore, the component can be styled using CSS to fit the aesthetic of your application.

### Conclusion

With its rich set of features and customization options, the `FancyCodeVerificationInput` component stands out as an ideal choice for applications requiring code verification, providing an enhanced and seamless user experience.
