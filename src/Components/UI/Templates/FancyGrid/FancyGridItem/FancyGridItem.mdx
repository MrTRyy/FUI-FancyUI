# FancyGrid.Item Component Documentation

`FancyGrid.Item` is a subcomponent of the `FancyGrid` component, designed for creating and managing individual items within the `FancyGrid` layout in React applications. It's built using styled-components and allows for responsive and flexible item placement within the grid.

## Installation

Ensure that `FancyGrid` is already set up in your project, as `FancyGrid.Item` is a part of it. Also, make sure React, TypeScript, and styled-components are installed.

## Usage

### Basic Use of FancyGrid.Item

`FancyGrid.Item` is used within the `FancyGrid` container and requires the `FancyGrid` component to be properly functioning.

**Props**:
- `gridSpace`: Specifies the number of columns the item should span within the grid.

**Example**:

```jsx
import FancyGrid from './FancyGrid';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <FancyGrid grid={12} space="2px">
      <FancyGrid.Item gridSpace={6}>
        {/* Content for a half-width item */}
      </FancyGrid.Item>
      <FancyGrid.Item gridSpace={6}>
        {/* Content for another half-width item */}
      </FancyGrid.Item>
    </FancyGrid>
  );
};
```

In this example, each `FancyGrid.Item` spans half the width of the grid (6 out of 12 columns).

### Responsive Design

`FancyGrid.Item` can be used to create responsive layouts within `FancyGrid`. Adjust the `gridSpace` prop based on the desired responsiveness of your layout.

### Customization

`FancyGrid.Item` can be customized further by passing additional styling props or by extending its styled component for more specific design needs.
