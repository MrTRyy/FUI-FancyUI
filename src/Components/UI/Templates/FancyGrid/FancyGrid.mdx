Before using `FancyGrid`, make sure you have React, TypeScript, and styled-components installed in your project.

## Usage

### FancyGrid Container

The `FancyGrid` container establishes the grid layout.

**Props**:
- `grid`: Specifies the number of columns in the grid (e.g., 12).
- `space`: Sets the spacing between grid items (e.g., "2px").

**Example**:

```jsx
import FancyGrid from './FancyGrid';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <FancyGrid grid={12} space="2px">
      {/* Grid items will be placed here */}
    </FancyGrid>
  );
};
```

### FancyGrid.Item

`FancyGrid.Item` represents individual items within the `FancyGrid`. 

**Props**:
- `gridSpace`: Determines the number of columns the item should span.

**Example**:

```jsx
<FancyGrid grid={12} space="2px">
  <FancyGrid.Item gridSpace={4}>
    {/* Content for the first item */}
  </FancyGrid.Item>
  <FancyGrid.Item gridSpace={4}>
    {/* Content for the second item */}
  </FancyGrid.Item>
  <FancyGrid.Item gridSpace={4}>
    {/* Content for the third item */}
  </FancyGrid.Item>
  {/* Since the grid limit is reached, the next item starts on a new line */}
  <FancyGrid.Item gridSpace={12}>
    {/* Content for the fourth item */}
  </FancyGrid.Item>
</FancyGrid>
```

## Responsive Design

`FancyGrid` supports responsive design. You can specify different `gridSpace` values for different screen sizes to ensure your layout adapts to various devices.

## Customization

You can customize the `FancyGrid` and `FancyGrid.Item` by passing additional styling props or by extending the styled components to fit your design requirements.
