# ComponentAsWrapper

`ComponentAsWrapper` is a React component designed for dynamic component wrapping. It allows for the injection of children into a specified wrapper component, enabling dynamic composition of React elements. This is particularly useful when the wrapping element needs to be determined at runtime or passed as a prop from a parent component.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

- `wrapper`: A React element that will be used as the wrapper for the children. This is not just a component type but an actual element.
- `children`: The content or elements that will be wrapped inside the `wrapper`.

## Usage

The `ComponentAsWrapper` is straightforward to use. You pass a React element as the `wrapper` and any children you want to be wrapped.

### Basic Example

In a basic scenario, you might use `ComponentAsWrapper` to dynamically decide the wrapper based on certain conditions:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ComponentAsWrapper from './path/to/ComponentAsWrapper';

function ExampleComponent({ useDiv }) {
  const WrapperElement = useDiv ? <div className="custom-div"> : <section className="custom-section">;

  return (
    <ComponentAsWrapper wrapper={WrapperElement}>
      <p>This content will be wrapped based on the condition</p>
    </ComponentAsWrapper>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, `ComponentAsWrapper` is used to conditionally wrap the content in either a `div` or a `section`, depending on the `useDiv` prop. The `wrapper` prop takes a React element (`<div>` or `<section>`), and the `children` prop takes the content (`<p>` element) to be wrapped.

## Advanced Usage

`ComponentAsWrapper` can also be used in more advanced scenarios, such as when building a component library where you want to give users the ability to define their own wrapper elements.

For example, in a library's modal component, you could allow users to specify their own wrapper element for the modal content:

```jsx
// In your modal component file
<ComponentAsWrapper wrapper={userDefinedWrapper}>
  {modalContent}
</ComponentAsWrapper>
```

This makes `ComponentAsWrapper` a powerful tool for building flexible and reusable component libraries.

By leveraging the `ComponentAsWrapper`, developers can create highly customizable UI components that adapt to various use cases, enhancing the overall flexibility and maintainability of the application.
