## FancyBar Documentation

*I think a lot about this, and I am a big fan of customizable components. In the current era, there's a plethora of excellent headers and bottom bars available, and I believe that developers should have the freedom to craft interfaces as they envision. Hence, I created the FancyBar. It primarily provides the theme of a component, leaving the rest up to your creativity. You can seamlessly provide your styles using inline styles, and they'll be appended to the existing class. Whether you're crafting a side nav, a header, or a bottom bar, FancyBar has got you covered.*

### Overview

FancyBar is a versatile component that can serve as the foundational block for various parts of an application's UI, such as headers, footers, sidebars, or any other type of bar. With its simple yet comprehensive prop system, it allows developers to customize its appearance and behavior, tailoring it to specific requirements.

### Initial Setup

1. **Import the Component**:

   Start by importing the `FancyBar` component into your file.
   
   ```javascript
   import FancyBar from 'path-to-FancyBar';
   ```

2. **Use the Component**:
   
   Use the FancyBar component, passing in any required props to customize its appearance and functionality.
   
   ```javascript
   <FancyBar themeType="primary" outlined>
     Your content goes here...
   </FancyBar>
   ```

### Using FancyBar

1. **Customize with Props**:

   FancyBar offers a range of props to customize its appearance:

   - `themeType`: Defines the theme color. This prop can accept any of the keys from the `TUiColorsType`.
   - `outlined`: A boolean that specifies whether the bar has an outlined style.
   - `layer`: This prop helps in defining the depth or z-index of the component.
   - `outlinedBackgroundStrength`: Determines the strength or intensity of the background when `outlined` is set to true.
   - `style`: Allows inline CSS styling to be applied to the bar.

   ```javascript
   <FancyBar themeType="dark" outlined layer={2}>
     Your themed and outlined bar content...
   </FancyBar>
   ```

2. **Inserting Children Components**:

   The FancyBar accepts child components, which allows developers to nest other components or elements inside the bar.
   
   ```javascript
   <FancyBar themeType="light">
     <button>Click Me!</button>
     <p>This is some text inside the FancyBar</p>
   </FancyBar>
   ```

### Advanced Styling

You're not limited to just the built-in styles. With the `style` prop, developers can pass inline styles to further customize the FancyBar's appearance. These styles will be appended to the predefined styles, allowing for greater flexibility.

```javascript
<FancyBar style={{ borderRadius: '10px', boxShadow: '0px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' }}>
  Custom styled FancyBar content...
</FancyBar>
```

### Conclusion

The FancyBar component is a testament to the philosophy that developers should be able to shape components the way they envision. With its myriad of customization options and the freedom to style as needed, FancyBar stands as a robust, flexible, and indispensable tool in the UI toolkit. Craft your perfect UI piece by piece, starting with the FancyBar.
