# FancyCodeVerificationInput

### Overview

The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` is a sophisticated input component tailored for single-input entries, such as verification codes. Offering an enhanced user experience, it not only transitions automatically to the subsequent input after a key press but also supports copy-paste functionality via `Ctrl + V`. Upon completing the code entry, the handler is activated, returning the entered value and its status, thus making it versatile and useful for various applications requiring code verification.

### Integration Steps

1. **Connect the Component to your Application**

   Import the component using the following:

   `import FancyCodeVerificationInput from './FancyCodeVerificationInput';`

2. **Initialize and Handle Input State**

   The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` relies on properties such as `isSuccess` and `errorMessage` to manage its internal state. It's essential to set up handlers to determine input success and display potential error messages.

### Example Usage

To best demonstrate the component's functionality, here's a simplified usage:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import FancyCodeVerificationInput from './FancyCodeVerificationInput';

const MyVerificationComponent = () => {
  const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');

  const handleVerification = (value) => {
    if (value === '123456') {
      setIsSuccess(true);
      setErrorMessage('');
    } else {
      setIsSuccess(false);
      setErrorMessage('Incorrect code');
    }
  };

  return (
    <FancyCodeVerificationInput
      length={6}
      handler={handleVerification}
      isSuccess={isSuccess}
      errorMessage={errorMessage}
    />
  );
};

export default MyVerificationComponent;
```

### Additional Features

The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` component accepts several props to enhance its functionality:

<Controls />

In this example, the `handleVerification` function checks if the entered code matches '123456'. Depending on the match, the input's success status and potential error message are updated.

### Customization

The `FancyCodeVerificationInput` component offers a wide range of customization options. Props such as `length`, `automaticCase`, and `debounceTime` allow you to adjust the input's behavior and appearance. Furthermore, the component can be styled using CSS to fit the aesthetic of your application.

### Conclusion

With its rich set of features and customization options, the `FancyCodeVerificationInput` component stands out as an ideal choice for applications requiring code verification, providing an enhanced and seamless user experience.
