## FancySwipeUpModal Documentation

### Overview

The FancySwipeUpModal is now powered by the `useFancySwipeUpStore`. This enhancement further simplifies the process of creating modals, while retaining the component's adaptability and feature-rich nature. With this update, developers can effortlessly integrate FancySwipeUpModal into their applications without the previous manual prop configurations.

### Initial Setup

1. **Render the Main Component in the Base File**:

   Place `<FancySwipeUpModal />` at the desired location in your main file.

2. **Specify the DOM Element for Rendering**:

   Create a DOM element where the modal will be rendered. For instance:

   ```html
   <div id="modal"></div>
   ```

3. **Connect the Modal to the DOM**:

   Pass the `appendToDomID` prop to the modal component. For instance, `appendToDomID="modal"`. This ties the modal to the specified DOM element. Configuration settings are now managed by the store, simplifying the overall process.

### Using the Modal

1. **Import the Store in the Component**:

   First, you need to import the `useFancySwipeUpModalStore` within the component where you intend to trigger the modal.

   ```javascript
   const openModal = useFancySwipeUpModalStore((state) => state.openSwipeUpModal);
   ```

2. **Open the Modal**:

   Use the `openModal` method with the following parameters:

   - Modal ID (e.g., "CustomerModal")
   - Child components to be displayed within the modal
   - Configuration object specifying various options

   ```javascript
   const openModalHandler = () => {
     openModal(
       'modalTest',
       <div style={{ display: 'flex', direction: 'column', gap: '18px' }}>
         <FancyTextInput label="Email" />
         <FancyButton onClick={() => closeModal('modalTest')} label="Close Modal"></FancyButton>
       </div>,
       {
         isCloseAble: false,
         isScalable: true,
       }
     );
   };
   ```

3. **Close the Modal**:

   To close the modal, you will need to utilize the `closeModal` method from the `useFancySwipeUpModalStore`.

   ```javascript
   const closeModal = useFancySwipeUpModalStore((state) => state.closeSwipeUpModal);
   ```

   You can then call `closeModal` with the ID of the modal you wish to close, as shown in the `openModalHandler` example above.

### Configuration Options

When opening a modal, you can provide a configuration object with the following optional properties:

- `themeType`: Accepts different theme values to alter the modal's appearance.
- `layer`: Sets the modal's depth.
- `isCloseAble`: A boolean that specifies if the user can close the modal.
- `isScalable`: A boolean that indicates whether the modal's height can be adjusted by the user.

### Conclusion

The revamped FancySwipeUpModal, powered by `useFancySwipeUpStore`, offers an even more streamlined approach to managing modals in applications. This update makes it easier to incorporate the modal component, providing a straightforward and efficient user experience.
