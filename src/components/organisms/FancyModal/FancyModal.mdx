## FancyModal Documentation

### Overview

The FancyModal component, streamlined with the `useFancyModalStore`, presents a modern approach to creating and managing modals in your applications. This approach simplifies the integration process by handling modal configurations automatically, allowing developers to effortlessly incorporate modals without the complications of manual prop settings.

### Setting Up FancyModal

1. **Render the Main Component in the Base File**:

   Ensure that the `<FancyModal />` component is added to a suitable location in your main file for correct modal behavior.

2. **Specify the DOM Element for Rendering**:

   Designate a DOM element to serve as the container for the modal. For example:

   ```html
   <div id="modalTest"></div>
   ```

### Implementing the Modal

1. **Import the Store in the Component**:

   Within the component where you plan to initiate the modal, start by importing the `useFancyModalStore`.

   ```javascript
   const openModal = useFancyModalStore((state) => state.openModal);
   ```

2. **Open the Modal**:

   To display the modal, employ the `openModal` function. This function requires the following parameters:

   - `appendToDomID`: The ID corresponding to the DOM element where the modal will appear.
   - Child components: The specific content or components you want to show within the modal.
   - Configuration object: This sets various modal properties.

   ```javascript
   const openModalHandler = () => {
     openModal(
       'modalTest',
       <div style={{ display: 'flex', direction: 'column', gap: '18px' }}>
         <FancyTextInput label="Email" />
         <FancyButton onClick={() => closeModal('modalTest')} label="Close Modal"></FancyButton>
       </div>,
       {
         isCloseAble: false,
       }
     );
   };
   ```

3. **Close the Modal**:

   To terminate an active modal, use the `closeModal` method from the `useFancyModalStore`.

   ```javascript
   const closeModal = useFancyModalStore((state) => state.closeModal);
   ```

   Subsequently, invoke `closeModal` using the ID of the modal you wish to shut, as depicted in the `openModalHandler` example.

### Configuration Options

The FancyModal's adaptability is showcased through the configuration object provided during modal initiation. One available option is:

- `isCloseAble`: A boolean that denotes whether users can manually terminate the modal.

### Conclusion

The evolved FancyModal, bolstered by `useFancyModalStore`, offers developers a smoother and more intuitive modal management experience. This refurbished framework undeniably simplifies the modal integration process, ensuring both efficient development and streamlined user interactions.
