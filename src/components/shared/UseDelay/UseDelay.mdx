# UseDelay Component

The `UseDelay` component is a React component designed to delay the rendering of its children based on an external boolean state and a specified delay time.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

- `children`: `React.ReactNode` - The content to be rendered after the delay.
- `externalStateBool` (optional): `boolean` - An external boolean state that influences the rendering behavior.
- `delay` (optional): `number` - The delay time in milliseconds before rendering the children. Defaults to 250 ms if not specified.

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import UseDelay from './UseDelay';

function Example() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>Toggle</button>
      <UseDelay externalStateBool={show} delay={500}>
        <div>Delayed content</div>
      </UseDelay>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the content within `UseDelay` will render only after the `show` state becomes true and after a delay of 500 milliseconds.

## Implementation Details

- The component uses a `useState` hook to manage the internal mount state.
- The `useEffect` hook listens for changes in the `externalStateBool` and handles the delay logic.
- A `setTimeout` is used to delay the state update which controls the rendering of children.
- The component ensures any ongoing timeout is cleared when the component is unmounted or when the `externalStateBool` changes, to prevent memory leaks.

## Notes

- The component is designed to handle changes in the external boolean state gracefully, resetting the timer if the state changes.
- If the `externalStateBool` is true, the content is rendered immediately without delay.
- When `externalStateBool` is false, the content rendering is delayed by the specified `delay` time.

This component can be useful in scenarios where conditional rendering is required based on certain conditions, allowing for a smoother user experience by delaying the rendering of components.
