## Setup Instructions

To use the `FancyModalHeadLine` component in your project, ensure you have the `Typography` and `FancyLine` components available, as these are dependencies. Import the `FancyModalHeadLine` component as follows:

```jsx
import { FancyModalHeadLine } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

## Example Usage

Here is a basic example of using the `FancyModalHeadLine` component within a modal:

```jsx
<FancyModalHeadLine title="Modal Title" subTitle="This is a subtitle for the modal." alignCenter={true} hr={true} />
```

<Canvas />

This will render a modal headline with a title and a subtitle, both centered, and a horizontal rule beneath them.
