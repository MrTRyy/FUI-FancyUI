# HeaderTitleWithLogo Component

This document outlines the `HeaderTitleWithLogo` component, designed for implementing a header template that incorporates both a logo and a title. The component is structured to allow for flexible theming and layout adjustments based on the provided properties.

## Brief Description

The `HeaderTitleWithLogo` component creates a header layout that includes a logo and a title. It is highly customizable through properties that control its appearance and behavior, such as theme type and layout layer. The component's implementation leverages styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling, ensuring seamless theme integration and style encapsulation.

## Setup Instructions

To use the `HeaderTitleWithLogo` component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `styled-components` installed in your project. If not, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install styled-components
# or
yarn add styled-components
```

2. Import the `HeaderTitleWithLogo` component where you intend to use it:

```javascript
import HeaderTitleWithLogo from '@/components/path/to/HeaderTitleWithLogo';
```

3. The component relies on a theming context provided by `styled-components`. Make sure your application is wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` and the necessary theme is passed to it.

## Example Usage

Here's an example demonstrating how to use the `HeaderTitleWithLogo` component within a project:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import HeaderTitleWithLogo from '@/components/path/to/HeaderTitleWithLogo';

const AppHeader = () => (
  <HeaderTitleWithLogo
    title="Your Project Title"
    logo={<img src="path/to/your/logo.png" alt="Logo" />}
    themeType="primary"
    layer="base"
  />
);

export default AppHeader;
```

This example renders a header with a specified logo and title, applying the "primary" theme type and "base" layer settings.

## Component Properties

The `HeaderTitleWithLogo` component accepts the following properties:

- **title** (`ReactNode | string`): The title content to be displayed in the header. This can be a string or any React node.
- **logo** (`ReactNode`): The logo to be displayed alongside the title. This should be a React node, such as an image or an SVG.
- **themeType** (`TUiColorsNotTransparent`): Specifies the color theme type for the heading. Defaults to "secondary" if not provided.
- **layer** (`TLayer`): Determines the layering context for theme color calculation, affecting the text color based on the provided theme.
- **...htmlProps** (`React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`): Any additional standard HTML attributes you wish to apply to the outer wrapper of the component.

This component is designed to be flexible and easily integrated into various header layouts, making it a versatile choice for adding a logo and title to your application's UI.
