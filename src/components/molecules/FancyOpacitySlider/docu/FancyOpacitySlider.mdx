### List of Used Components

- **SliderMarker**: A small UI component that indicates the current position on the slider. It's designed to move along the slider to show the selected opacity level.
- **ColorIndicator**: Displays the color with the currently selected opacity. It visually represents the result of the opacity adjustment.
- **CheckerBoardPattern**: A background pattern that helps users see the transparency level of the selected color. It is especially useful for visualizing fully transparent or nearly transparent colors.
- **Wrapper, SliderContainer, OpacityGradient (Styled Components)**: These styled components are used for the layout and styling of the slider, ensuring it is visually appealing and functional.
