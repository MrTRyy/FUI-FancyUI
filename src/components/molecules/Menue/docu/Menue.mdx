import { Meta, Title, Description, Controls, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';

import * as MenueListStories from './Menue.stories';

<Meta of={MenueListStories} />

<Title />

<Description />

## Setup Instructions

To use the `Menue` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Menue` component where you intend to use it:

```jsx
import { Menue } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. If using TypeScript, you can import the type definitions for prop validation:

```jsx
import { TMenue, TMenueWithHTMLAttributes } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

## Example Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `Menue` component in a React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Menue from './Menue'; // Adjust the path as needed

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Menue themeType="secondary" layer={3} outlined={true}>
      <div>Menu Item 1</div>
      <div>Menu Item 2</div>
      <div>Menu Item 3</div>
    </Menue>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This example creates a `Menue` with three items, customizing the component with a secondary theme, a layer depth of 3, and an outlined style.

## Component Properties

The `Menue` component accepts the following properties:

- `children?: React.ReactNode` - The content of the menu list. This prop is optional and allows any React nodes as children.
- `themeType?: TUiColorsNotTransparent` - Specifies the theme type for the menu list, affecting its color scheme. This prop is optional. Types include all non-transparent UI colors defined in `TUiColorsNotTransparent`.
- `layer?: TLayer` - Determines the layer or depth effect of the menu list. This prop is optional. The type `TLayer` includes predefined layer depth values.
- `outlined?: boolean` - Specifies whether the menu list should have an outlined style. This prop is optional and defaults to `false`.

In addition to the above properties, `Menue` also inherits all properties from `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`, allowing for further HTML attribute customizations such as `className`, `style`, etc.

The `Menue` component offers flexibility and customization, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and design requirements.
