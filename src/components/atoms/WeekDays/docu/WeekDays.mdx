The `WeekDays` component is a React component designed to display a list of weekdays, from Monday to Sunday, customizable in terms of starting day, theme, border style, and size. It's a part of a larger design system, ideal for calendar interfaces or any application needing to display week days dynamically.

## Brief Description

This component dynamically generates a list of weekdays based on the provided start day. It supports customization for visual aspects such as theme color, border styling, and text size. The component utilizes the `Typography` atom for rendering each day, ensuring consistent styling across your application.

## Setup Instructions

To use the `WeekDays` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `WeekDays` component where you intend to use it:

```jsx
import { WeekDays } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. If using TypeScript, ensure the type definitions are imported for prop validation:

```jsx
import { TWeekDays, TWeekDaysWithNativeAttr } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

3. Make sure to import necessary types and utilities if you're extending or customizing the component.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `WeekDays` component with custom settings:

```jsx
<WeekDays
  themeType="primary"
  layer={1}
  sizeC="lg"
  border="bottom"
  startWeekOn={1} // Start the week on Monday
/>
```

This configuration will display the weekdays starting from Monday, with a large font size, a bottom border, in a primary theme color, and on layer 1.
