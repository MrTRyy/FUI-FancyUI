## Setup Instructions

To use the `YearSelector` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `YearSelector` component where you intend to use it:

```jsx
import { YearSelector } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. If using TypeScript, you can import the type definitions for prop validation:

```jsx
import { TYearSelector, TYearSelectorWithHTMLAttributes } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

3. Make sure to import any necessary supporting types or utilities if you plan on extending or customizing the component further.

## Example Usage

```jsx
<YearSelector
  selectedYear={2024}
  sizeC="lg"
  themeType="primary"
  themeTypeSecondary="secondary"
  layer={3}
  textLayer={0}
  borderRadius="medium"
  minYear={2000}
  maxYear={2050}
  yearChangeHandler={(newYear) => console.log(newYear)}
  ariaTextLeftArrow="Previous Year"
  ariaTextRightArrow="Next Year"
/>
```

<Canvas />

This configuration sets up a `YearSelector` for the year 2024 with large size, primary and secondary theme types, layering for depth control, medium border radius, a minimum year of 2000, a maximum year of 2050, and arrow buttons for year navigation. It also includes accessibility text for the left and right arrows.

## Component Properties

<Controls />

The `TYearSelector` type outlines the props that can be passed to the `YearSelector` component, allowing for a high degree of customization to meet various design and functionality needs.
