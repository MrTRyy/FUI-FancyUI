# PasswordInput Component

## Brief Description

The `PasswordInput` component is a React component designed for input fields where users can enter passwords. This component integrates a visibility toggle feature, represented by an eye icon, allowing users to switch between showing or hiding their password. It leverages the `PasswordEye` component for the toggle functionality and wraps the input field with a styled wrapper to position the toggle icon appropriately. This component supports customization and theming through various props, making it versatile for different design requirements.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure your project is set up with React and styled-components, as this component utilizes styled-components for styling.
2. Import the `PasswordInput` component into your project:

```jsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@tobitry/fui-fancyui';
```

3. If using TypeScript, ensure the type definitions are imported for prop validation:

```jsx
import {
  TPasswordInputProps,
  TNativePassowrdInputAttrs,
  TPasswordInputPropsWithNativeAttrs,
} from '@tobitry/fui-fancyui';
```

## Example Usage

Here's how to use the `PasswordInput` component within a form, including customizing the eye icons:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PasswordInput } from '@tobitry/fui-fancyui';

function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <PasswordInput
        placeholder="Enter your password"
        customEyeOpen={<CustomOpenEyeIcon />}
        customEyeCrossed={<CustomCrossedEyeIcon />}
      />
      {/* Additional form fields and submit button */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Component Properties

- **value** (`string`): The input value.
- **align** (`TTextAlignLC`): Text alignment within the input. Can be `'left'`, `'center'`, or `'right'`.
- **themeType** (`Exclude<TUiColorsMain, 'accent'>`): Defines the theme color of the component, excluding `'accent'` colors.
- **layer** (`TLayer`): Used for depth or layering styling, influencing the appearance of the eye icon.
- **customEyeOpen** (`React.ReactNode`): Custom component or icon to be used for the "open eye" state.
- **customEyeCrossed** (`React.ReactNode`): Custom component or icon to be used for the "crossed-out eye" state.

The component also accepts all native input attributes through `TNativePasswordInputAttrs`, excluding `type` and `value` to ensure proper functionality and integration with the password visibility toggle feature.

## Styling with WrapperEye

The `WrapperEye` styled component is used internally to position the visibility toggle icon. It is styled to place the icon within the input field, using properties like `themeType` and `layer` for theming. Custom styling adjustments can be made to `WrapperEye` if you're extending or modifying the `PasswordInput` component for your specific use case.

This component combines functionality and style to enhance user experience in forms that require password inputs, ensuring ease of use and integration within various design systems.
