## Setup Instructions

To use the `FancyLine` component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `FancyLine` component into your file:

```jsx
import { FancyLine } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. Use the component in your JSX code, passing in any required or optional props to customize it according to your needs.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the `FancyLine` component with some of its customizable properties:

```jsx
<FancyLine direction="horizontal" thickness="2px" length="100%" margin="10px" themeType="accent" layer={0} />
```

This will render a horizontal line with a thickness of 2px, spanning the full width of its container, with a margin of 10px on all sides, styled with the 'accent' theme type and on the 'base' layer.

## Component Properties

<Controls />

Additionally, the `FancyLine` component inherits all properties from `HTMLAttributes<HTMLHRElement>`, allowing for standard HTML line attributes to be applied, such as `className` and `id`.
