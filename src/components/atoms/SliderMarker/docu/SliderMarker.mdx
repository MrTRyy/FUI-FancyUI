## Setup Instructions

To use the `SliderMarker` component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `SliderMarker` component where you intend to use it:

```jsx
import { SliderMarker } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. If using TypeScript, you can import the type definitions for prop validation:

```jsx
import { TSliderMarker, TSliderMarkerWithHTMLAttrs } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

## Example Usage

Here's an example demonstrating how to use the `SliderMarker` component within a slider component:

```jsx
<SliderMarker position="50%" theme={yourTheme}>
  <div>Your content here</div>
</SliderMarker>
```

In this example, the `SliderMarker` is placed at 50% of the slider's width. The `theme` prop is passed to style the marker according to your application's theme. You can replace `"Your content here"` with any React node to display inside the marker.
