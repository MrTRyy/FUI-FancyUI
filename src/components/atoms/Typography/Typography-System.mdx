## Typography System

Our typography system is designed to ensure consistency, readability, and visual hierarchy across our user interface. It provides a set of predefined text styles that you can use to style text elements in your application or website.

The typography system includes a variety of text styles, each tailored for specific UI elements. These styles are defined in a structured object, making them easy to reference and apply throughout your project.

Each text style includes the following properties:

- `size`: The font size of the text.
- `lineHeight`: The distance between baselines of consecutive lines of text.
- `letterSpacing`: The spacing between characters, which can affect readability and aesthetic.
- `weight`: The thickness of the characters, representing the font weight.
