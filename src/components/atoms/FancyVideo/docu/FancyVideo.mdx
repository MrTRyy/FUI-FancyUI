import { Meta, Story, Title, Controls, Description } from '@storybook/blocks';

import * as FancyVideoStories from './FancyVideo.stories';

<Meta of={FancyVideoStories} />

<Title />

<Description />

## Setup Instructions

To use the FancyVideo component in your project, ensure you have the component and its dependencies correctly imported. Here is a basic setup:

1. Import the FancyVideo component into your React file:

```jsx
import FancyVideo from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. Import necessary types if you intend to explicitly type your component props:

   ```jsx
   import { TFancyVideoWithHTMLAttrs, FancyVideoHTMLProps, TFancyVideo } from 'fui-fancyui';
   ```

## Example Usage

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to embed a FancyVideo component within a React application. This example includes autoplay, muting, a custom aspect ratio, and a darken effect:

```jsx
<FancyVideo autoPlay muted aspectRatio="16/9" darken>
  <FancyVideo.Source src="path/to/your/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</FancyVideo>
```

This setup will render a video that auto-plays, is muted, has a 16:9 aspect ratio, and is darkened to focus attention on the video content.

## Component Properties

<Controls />

Additionally, `FancyVideo` accepts all standard HTML video attributes (`FancyVideoHTMLProps`) as props, allowing for further customization like `controls`, `loop`, etc.

**Note**: The `FancyVideo.Source` component is used to specify different video sources for the player, enabling support for multiple video formats and fallback options.
