## FancyBox Documentation

I have given this a lot of thought, and I am a great enthusiast of customizable components. In the present times, there is an abundance of excellent headers and bottom bars, and I believe developers should have the liberty to design interfaces as they imagine. Therefore, I developed the FancyBox. It primarily offers the theme for a component, leaving the rest to your creativity. You can effortlessly integrate your styles using inline styles, and they will be added to the existing class. Whether you are designing a side nav, a header, or a bottom bar, FancyBox has everything you need.

### Overview

FancyBox is a versatile component that can act as the core element for various parts of an application's UI, such as headers, footers, sidebars, or any other type of bar. With its straightforward yet extensive property system, it enables developers to customize its look and functionality, adapting it to specific needs.

### Initial Setup

1. **Import the Component**:

   Begin by importing the `FancyBox` component into your file.

   ```jsx
   import FancyBox from 'path-to-FancyBox';
   ```

2. **Use the Component**:

   Utilize the FancyBox component, inputting any necessary properties to modify its look and features.

   ```jsx
   <FancyBox themeType="primary" outlined>
     Your content here...
   </FancyBox>
   ```

### Using FancyBox

1. **Customization with Properties**:

   FancyBox provides various properties for customizing its appearance:

<Canvas />

<Controls />

```jsx
<FancyBox themeType="secondary" outlined layer={2}>
  Your themed and outlined bar content...
</FancyBox>
```

2. **Incorporating Child Components**:

   FancyBox accepts child components, enabling developers to embed other components or elements within the bar.

   ```jsx
   <FancyBox themeType="accent">
     <button>Click Me!</button>
     <p>This is some text inside the FancyBox</p>
   </FancyBox>
   ```

### Advanced Styling

You are not confined to the predefined styles. With the `style` property, developers can input inline styles to further personalize the appearance of the FancyBox. These styles will be combined with the preexisting styles, offering more versatility.

```jsx
<FancyBox externalStyle={{ borderRadius: '10px', boxShadow: '0px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' }}>
  A FancyBox with custom style...
</FancyBox>
```

### Conclusion

The FancyBox component embodies the philosophy that developers should have the freedom to mold components as they see fit. With its wide range of customization choices and the ability to style as desired, FancyBox emerges as a sturdy, adaptable, and essential tool in the UI toolkit. Begin crafting your ideal UI, one piece at a time, starting with the FancyBox.
