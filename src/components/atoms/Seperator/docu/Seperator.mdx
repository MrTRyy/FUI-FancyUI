## Setup Instructions

To use the `Seperator` component in your project, ensure you have imported it along with its model and styled components. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Import the Component**:

   - Import the `Seperator` component into your React file where you intend to use it.

   ```jsx
   import { Seperator } from 'fui-fancyui';
   ```

2. **Import Necessary Types**:

   - If you're using TypeScript, import the types to leverage type-checking for the component's props.

   ```tsx
   import { ISeperator } from 'fui-fancyui';
   ```

3. **Usage**:
   - Use the component within your JSX code, passing in the appropriate props as needed.

## Example Usage

Below is an example showcasing how to incorporate the `Seperator` component with some of its key properties:

```jsx
<Seperator
  label="Section Title"
  textAlignment="center"
  themeType="primary"
  layer={3}
  fontWeight="bold"
  icon={<YourIconComponent />}
  sizeC="lg"
/>
```

This example demonstrates a `Seperator` with a central-aligned label, custom theme, layer styling, bold font weight, an icon, and a larger size setting.
