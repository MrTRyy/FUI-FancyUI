import { Meta, Title, Description, Controls } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as PageNumberListStories from './PageNumberList.stories';

<Meta of={PageNumberListStories} />

<Title />

<Description />

## Setup Instructions

1. Import the `PageNumberList` component into your file:
   ```jsx
   import { PageNumberList } from '@tobitry/fui-fancyui';
   ```
2. Ensure that the `styled-components` package is installed in your project for styled components to work correctly.
3. Utilize the component in your JSX by passing the required props (`totalPages`, `currentPage`) and optional props (`pageLimits`, `onClick`) as needed.

## Example Usage

```jsx
<PageNumberList
  totalPages={10}
  currentPage={5}
  pageLimits={3}
  onClick={(page) => console.log(`Navigating to page ${page}`)}
/>
```

This example renders a `PageNumberList` with 10 total pages, setting the current page to 5. It limits the number of pages shown to 3 and logs the page number to the console when a page button is clicked.

## Component Properties

- `totalPages` (required): `number` - The total number of pages to paginate through.
- `currentPage` (required): `number` - The currently active page.
- `pageLimits` (optional): `number` - The maximum number of page buttons to display at once. Defaults to 3 if not specified.
- `onClick` (optional): `(page: number) => void` - A callback function that is called when a page button is clicked. Receives the page number as its argument.

## Additional Notes

- The `PageNumberList` component intelligently calculates which page numbers to display based on the current page, total pages, and page limits, including the display of ellipses (`...`) to indicate skipped page numbers.
- Styled with `styled-components`, the component allows for easy customization of styles via theme-based styling and conditional styling for active states.
- The `generateNumbers` utility function is used internally to calculate the array of page numbers or ellipses to display, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to various pagination scenarios.
