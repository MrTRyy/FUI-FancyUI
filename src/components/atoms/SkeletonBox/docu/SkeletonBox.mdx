<Description />

The `SkeletonBox` component is designed to serve as a placeholder during the loading state of content, providing a visual cue to users that content is in the process of loading. It supports customizable dimensions, aspect ratios, border radius, and theme-based styling to seamlessly integrate with various design systems. The component leverages styled-components for dynamic styling, ensuring adaptability across different UI layers and themes.

## Setup Instructions

To use the `SingleInput` component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `SkeletonBox` component where you intend to use it:

```jsx
import { SkeletonBox } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. If using TypeScript, ensure the type definitions are imported for prop validation:

```jsx
import { TSkeletonBox, TSkeletonBoxWithHTMLAttrs } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

## Example Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `SkeletonBox` component as a loading placeholder for an image:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import SkeletonBox from 'fui-fancyui';

function ImagePlaceholder() {
  return <SkeletonBox themeType="secondary" layer={1} sizeW="lg" sizeH="md" aspectRatio="16:9" borderRadius="md" />;
}
```

<Canvas />

## Component Properties

The `SkeletonBox` component accepts several props to customize its appearance:

<Controls />

Additionally, it accepts all standard HTML div attributes (`React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`) as part of its props, providing flexibility for accessibility enhancements and HTML standard compliance.

## Styling

`StyledSkeletonBox` dynamically applies styling based on the provided props and the current theme. It includes an animation to indicate loading, adjustable dimensions, and theme-based color variations. This approach ensures that the component can adapt to different design systems and maintain consistency across various parts of an application.
