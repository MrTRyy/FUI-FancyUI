<Description />

The InputLabel component is a versatile, styled label element designed for use within form fields or any input context in a React application. It enhances the standard label with additional styling and behavior based on props like activity state, theme, alignment, and variant. This component is part of a broader design system aiming to provide cohesive and flexible UI elements for building intuitive and accessible user interfaces.

## Setup Instructions

To incorporate the InputLabel component into your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the InputLabel component and its dependencies imported into your project. Begin by importing the component itself:

```jsx
import InputLabel from '@/components/atoms/InputLabel/InputLabel';
```

2. Import any necessary types or utilities that the InputLabel depends on, such as theme types or styling utilities, from their respective modules within your project structure.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the InputLabel component within a form field, demonstrating how to apply it with some common props for styling and functionality:

```jsx
<InputLabel
  isActive={true}
  systemMessageType="error"
  themeType="primary"
  layer={2}
  align="left"
  lableVariant="animated"
>
  Your Label Here
</InputLabel>
```

This setup configures an InputLabel that is active, styled with an error message type in a primary theme, positioned on the second layer, aligned to the left, and uses an animated variant for dynamic interaction effects.

## Component Properties

Besides these specific props, `InputLabel` also supports all native label HTML attributes (`TInputLabelNativeAttrs`), excluding 'style', to ensure full compatibility and accessibility within forms.

**Note**: The component utilizes styled-components for its styling logic, including dynamic styles based on props for responsiveness and interactivity, ensuring a seamless integration into React projects following modern design practices.
