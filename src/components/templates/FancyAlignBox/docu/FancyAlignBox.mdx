## Setup Instructions

To use the `FancyAlignBox` component in your project, ensure that you have the `TextInput` and `InputWrapper` components available within your project structure, typically under the `atoms` and `molecules` directories, respectively. Import the `FancyTextInput` component where you need to use it:

1. Import the `FancyAlignBox` component where you intend to use it:

```jsx
import { FancyAlignBox } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

2. If using TypeScript, you can import the type definitions for prop validation:

```jsx
import { TFancyAlignBox } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

After installing the required library, you can import and use the `FancyTextInput` component in your project as follows:

### Example Usage

```jsx
<FancyAlignBox
  as="section"
  justify="center"
  align="center"
  direction="row"
  gap="10px"
  padding="20px"
  margin="5px"
  externalStyle={{ boxShadow: '0px 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)' }}
>
  <div>Your Content Here</div>
</FancyAlignBox>
```

This example creates a section with centered content, both horizontally and vertically, with a row direction, specified gap, padding, and margin. It also applies an external shadow style.
