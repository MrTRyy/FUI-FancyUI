# FancyGrid.Item Component Documentation

`FancyGrid.Item` is a subcomponent of the `FancyGrid` component, designed for creating and managing individual items within the `FancyGrid` layout in React applications. It leverages styled-components for styling and is built to support responsive and flexible item placements within the grid.

## Installation

Before using `FancyGrid.Item`, ensure that `FancyGrid` is already set up in your project, as `FancyGrid.Item` is an integral part of it. Also, confirm that React, TypeScript, and styled-components are installed in your project environment.

## Usage

### Basic Use of FancyGrid.Item

`FancyGrid.Item` is meant to be used within the `FancyGrid` container. It requires the `FancyGrid` component to be properly functioning.

**Example**:

```jsx
import FancyGrid from './FancyGrid';
import FancyGridItem from './FancyGridItem';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <FancyGrid simpleGrid={12} gap="10px">
      <FancyGridItem gridSpace={6}>{/* Content for a half-width item */}</FancyGridItem>
      <FancyGridItem gridSpace={6}>{/* Content for another half-width item */}</FancyGridItem>
    </FancyGrid>
  );
};
```

<Canvas />

**Props**:

<Controls />

In this example, each `FancyGridItem` spans half the width of the grid, taking up 6 out of 12 columns.

### Responsive Design

`FancyGrid.Item` supports responsive design by allowing you to specify custom breakpoints. These breakpoints adjust the `gridSpace` dynamically based on the screen width.

**Example with Breakpoints**:

```jsx
const itemBreakpoints = [
  { breakpoint: '768px', gridSize: 1 }, // At screens smaller than 768px, the item takes one column.
];

<FancyGridItem gridSpace={3} breakpoints={itemBreakpoints}>
  {/* Content */}
</FancyGridItem>;
```

In this example, the item will span 3 columns by default, but on screens smaller than 768px, it will take up only 1 column, adapting to a mobile view.

### Customization

`FancyGrid.Item` can be customized further through styled-components. You can pass additional styling properties or extend its styled component for more specific design needs. This allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility in design.
