## How to Use the Theme for Styling Components in FUI-FancyUI

FUI-FancyUI provides a comprehensive solution for styling your components with a theme-driven approach, ensuring a consistent look and feel across your application. This document guides you through the two primary methods for utilizing the theme within your components: using Styled-Components and leveraging CSS variables.

### 1. Using Styled-Components with TTheme

To incorporate the theme into your styled components, follow these steps:

1. **Import TTheme:** Begin by importing the `TTheme` type from FUI-FancyUI, which is necessary for TypeScript users to leverage the theme's type definitions.

   ```jsx
   import { TTheme } from 'fui-Fancyui';
   ```

2. **Apply TTheme:** Utilize `TTheme` within your styled components to access and apply theme values directly. Here's an example of creating a styled `div` that uses the primary color from the theme:

   ```jsx
   const StyledDiv =
     styled.div <
     { theme: TTheme } >
     `
     background-color: ${({ theme }) => theme.colors.primary['0']};
   `;
   ```

This method ensures that your components are dynamically styled according to the current theme, making it easy to maintain consistency and apply theme changes across your application.

### 2. Utilizing CSS Variables Synced with the Theme State

Another approach is to use CSS variables that are synchronized with the theme state, allowing for easy theming directly within your CSS or styled components. Here's how:

1. **Define Your CSS Using Theme Variables:** Use the provided CSS variables corresponding to the theme's design tokens for properties such as colors, spacing, font sizes, etc. For instance, to apply a background color using a theme color, you would write:

   ```css
   .fancy_class {
     background-color: var(--colors-primary-8);
   }
   ```

These CSS variables are automatically updated to match the current theme, ensuring that your styles are always in sync with the theme state.

### The FancyThemeProvider Component

The `FancyThemeProvider` component plays a crucial role in managing the theme state and ensuring that the provided theme is accessible throughout your component tree. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

- **Theme Initialization:** On its first render, `FancyThemeProvider` initializes the theme by setting it in the theme store, which is then used to generate and apply CSS variables across the application.
- **Dynamic Theme Updates:** It listens for changes in the theme and updates the CSS variables accordingly, ensuring that your application's look and feel is consistent with the current theme.
- **Fallback to Default Theme:** In cases where no theme is provided, `FancyThemeProvider` defaults to using a pre-defined theme, ensuring that your application has a consistent styling baseline.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the `FancyThemeProvider`, you can effortlessly style your components in a theme-consistent manner, providing a cohesive user experience throughout your FUI-FancyUI based application.
