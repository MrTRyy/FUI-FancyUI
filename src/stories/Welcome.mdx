In this MDX file:

- The `import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';` and `<Meta title="Welcome/Introduction" />` lines set up the meta information for the Storybook page.
- The `## Setup` and `## Usage` sections provide instructions and code examples. The code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (`````), with an optional language identifier (`bash`or`jsx` in this case) to enable syntax highlighting.

Now, when you run Storybook, you'll have a starting page with setup instructions and code examples.
