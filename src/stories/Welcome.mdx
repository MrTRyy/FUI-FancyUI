# Welcome to FancyUI (FUI) - Your Go-To for Cool, Customizable UI Components! 🌟

Hello there, UI enthusiasts! Welcome to the world of FancyUI (FUI), where simplicity meets sophistication. Ever found yourself thinking, "Gee, I wish my UI components could be as unique as my project"? Well, your wish is our command! 🧞‍♂️

## Why FancyUI? 🤔

I created FUI because, honestly, I was tired of the same old, restricted UI libraries. I wanted something that blended simple UI elements with advanced components that could be customized or even rebuilt from scratch. Think LEGO, but for UIs! 🚀

### Atomic Structure: The Heart of FUI 🎨

FUI is built on an atomic structure, meaning you can break down each component into its tiniest parts. No more feeling boxed in by inflexible UIs! 📦 [Atomic explanation](./?path=/docs/stories-atomicstructure--docs)

#### Let's Talk Code: React TS with Styled-Components

Take our `FancyInput`, for example. It's composed of:

- A snazzy Label 🏷️
- A sleek Underline 📏
- Helpful ErrorMessage 🚫
- Cool Icon ✨
- And the all-important InputField 🖊️

If a component doesn't quite fit your vibe, just grab the parts you like and build your own version. Remix, rebuild, reinvent! 🛠️

### Keeping It Simple: ThemeStore 🎨

Our themeStore is all about ease and elegance. Provide three colors - "Primary", "Secondary", "Accent" - and voilà, the theme store crafts 10 shades of each for you. It's like magic, but with colors! 🌈

### The Magic of Layers: Depth & Dimension 🎭

FUI is built on a layering concept. Think of it as painting your UI canvas:

- Layer 0: Your base color 🖌️
- Layer 1: A step up, like for a card 🃏
- Layer 2: Highlighting elements within a card 🌟

You can even jump layers for more impact:

- 0 for the background
- 2 for the card
- 4 for a card within a card

It's like creating a 3D effect with colors! 🌇

In summary, FancyUI is here to make your UI dreams come true. Dive in, play around, and create something uniquely yours. Happy coding! 💻🎉
