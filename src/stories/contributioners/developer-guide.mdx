# Developer Guide

Welcome to the FancyUI (FUI) community! As an open-source project, we thrive on collaboration and innovation. Here's how you can contribute and make an impact:

## Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the Repository**: Navigate to the FUI repository on GitHub and click on the 'Fork' button. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHUb account.
2. **Clone Locally**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`. This gives you a local workspace to start your development.

## Identify or Create an Issue

1. **Issue Exploration**: Browse the existing issues in the FUI project to find something you're interested in working on.
2. **New Issue Creation**: If you have a new idea or spot a bug, feel free to create a new issue. Provide a detailed description to help others understand your proposal or the problem.

## Branch Out

1. **Create a New Branch**: From your forked repository, create a new branch for your specific issue or feature. Use a clear and descriptive name for your branch to maintain an organized workflow.

## Innovate and Develop

1. **Code and Create**: In your branch, start working on the issue or feature. Whether it's refining existing components or crafting new ones, ensure you adhere to atomic design principles and the project's coding standards.
2. **Commit Your Changes**: Regularly commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. This helps document your development process and makes it easier for others to follow.

## Test and Assure Quality

1. **Run Tests**: In your local environment, run `npm run predeploy` to execute lint, format and build and check for any issues.
2. **Review and Refine**: Carefully review any errors or issues that arise. Strive for high-quality and robust contributions.

## Create a Pull Request

1. **Push to Your Fork**: Once your changes are complete and tested, push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Create a PR to the main FUI repository. Provide a comprehensive description of your changes and how they contribute to the project.

## Collaboration and Review

1. **Engage in Discussions**: Be active in the conversation around your PR. Answer questions and address feedback from the community and maintainers.
2. **Revise if Necessary**: Make any necessary changes based on the feedback. This collaborative process ensures that every contribution is valuable and aligns with the project's goals.

Once your PR is approved and merged, your contributions will become part of the FancyUI, enhancing the toolkit for everyone. Thank you for your commitment to open-source innovation!
