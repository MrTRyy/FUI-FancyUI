## Good to Know: Folder-Contents

This document outlines the standard structure for components within our library, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and ease of use. Each component should have a dedicated folder with a specific set of files, each serving a distinct purpose. Please adhere to this structure when creating or modifying components.

### Component Structure Overview

Each component should have its own folder with the following structure:

```
ComponentName/
├── utils/
├── docu/
├── ComponentName.stories.tsx
├── index.ts
├── ComponentName.tsx
├── ComponentName.style.tsx
└── ComponentName.model.ts
```

### Description of Component Structure

#### 1. `utils/` (Folder)

- **Purpose:** Contains helper functions specifically for the component. These utility functions should not be directly related to the component's UI but support its functionality.
- **Note:** If the utility functions are generic and used across multiple components, consider placing them in a global `utils/` folder at the root level of the library.

#### 2. `docu/` (Folder)

- **Purpose:** Contains all documentation files for the component, including Markdown (`.mdx`) files and Storybook files (if there are multiple).
- **When to Include:** Include this folder if the component has multiple documentation files. For a single documentation file, you can place it directly in the component's folder.

#### 3. `ComponentName.stories.tsx` (File)

- **Purpose:** Holds the Storybook documentation for the component. This is where you showcase the component's variants, props, and usage.
- **Note:** Ensure to follow Storybook's best practices for writing stories.

#### 4. `index.ts` (File)

- **Purpose:** Serves as the entry point for the component. It exports the component itself and any types or subcomponents that are part of its public API.
- **Note:** Keeping exports in one file simplifies imports for users of your library.

#### 5. `ComponentName.tsx` (File)

- **Purpose:** Contains the React component code. This is where you define the component's structure, logic, and behavior.
- **Best Practices:** Aim for clear, concise, and well-commented code. Remember to define propTypes and defaultProps if applicable.

#### 6. `ComponentName.style.tsx` (File)

- **Purpose:** Holds the styled-components for the component. This is where you define your component's styling, leveraging the power of styled-components for dynamic styling based on props.
- **Best Practices:** Ensure your styles are clean and well-organized. Consider using theming for consistent styling across your library.

#### 7. `ComponentName.model.ts` (File)

- **Purpose:** Defines TypeScript types or interfaces for the component's props and any other relevant types.
- **Best Practices:** Strongly typing your components enhances code readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects.

### Additional Notes:

- **Consistency:** Adhering to this structure across all components ensures a predictable and easy-to-navigate codebase.
- **Review Existing Components:** If you're new to the project, review a few existing components to get a feel for how they are structured and documented.
- **Feedback and Improvement:** This structure is not set in stone. If you have suggestions for improving the component structure or the developer guide, please share your feedback with the team.

By following this guide, you contribute to a cohesive and robust UI Library that developers enjoy working with. Happy coding!
