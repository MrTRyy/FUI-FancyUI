# `useShowAreaOfArray` Hook Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the `useShowAreaOfArray` custom React hook. The hook is designed for selecting a specific area or segment of an array based on the given parameters.

## Installation

Before using the `useShowAreaOfArray` hook, ensure it is imported into your React component file:

```jsx
import { useShowAreaOfArray } from 'path-to-your-hooks-folder';
```

## API

`useShowAreaOfArray` is a generic hook which takes an object of type `TuseShowAreaOfArray<T>` as a parameter. The type parameter `T` represents the type of elements in the array you are working with.

### Parameters

The hook accepts the following properties in its parameter object:

- `array` (required): An array of type `T` which is the source from which you want to select a specific area.
- `areaForward` (required): A number indicating how many elements to include forward from the `areaStart` index.
- `areaBackward` (required): A number indicating how many elements to include backward from the `areaStart` index.
- `areaStart` (optional, default = 0): A number indicating the starting index of the area in the array. If not provided, it defaults to 0.

### Return

The hook returns an object containing the following property:

- `areaItems`: An array of type `T` representing the selected area of the original array.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use `useShowAreaOfArray` in a functional React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useShowAreaOfArray } from 'path-to-your-hooks-folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

  // Using the hook
  const { areaItems } = useShowAreaOfArray({
    array: myArray,
    areaForward: 2,
    areaBackward: 1,
    areaStart: 4,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {areaItems.map((item, index) => (
        <p key={index}>{item}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `areaItems` will contain elements from the `myArray` array starting from index 4 (inclusive), including 1 element backward and 2 elements forward. So, the `areaItems` will contain `[3, 4, 5, 6]`.

## Notes

- Ensure that the values for `areaForward` and `areaBackward` are not greater than the length of the array to avoid unexpected results.
- If `areaStart` is set to a negative value, it will default to 0.
- The hook uses the `useMemo` hook for performance optimization, recalculating the area only when the array or any of the parameters change.

This hook can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to display a specific segment of an array, such as in pagination, sliders, or data visualization.
