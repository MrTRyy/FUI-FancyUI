## `useBreakpointComparison` Hook

### Brief Description

The `useBreakpointComparison` hook compares the current active breakpoint with a specified target breakpoint to determine their relative sizes.

### Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and hooks installed and imported.
2. Import the `useBreakpointComparison` hook from its module.

```javascript
import { useBreakpointComparison } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `useBreakpointComparison` hook in a component:

```javascript
import { useBreakpointComparison } from 'fui-fancyui';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const comparison = useBreakpointComparison({
    breakpointId: 'md',
    breakPoints: [
      { id: 'sm', value: '640px' },
      { id: 'md', value: '768px' },
      { id: 'lg', value: '1024px' },
    ],
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {comparison === 'isEqual' && <p>The current breakpoint is equal to the target breakpoint.</p>}
      {comparison === 'isBigger' && <p>The current breakpoint is larger than the target breakpoint.</p>}
      {comparison === 'isSmaller' && <p>The current breakpoint is smaller than the target breakpoint.</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Component Properties

- `props: TuseBreakpointComparison`: The properties for configuring the hook.
  - `breakpointId` (string): The ID of the target breakpoint to compare with. **Required**.
  - `breakPoints` (Array): An array of breakpoints, each having an `id` and `value` property. **Required**.

### List of Used Components

- **`useActiveBreakpoint`**: A hook that retrieves the currently active breakpoint based on a provided list of breakpoints.
