# useWindowDimensions Hook

The `useWindowDimensions` hook is a custom React hook that provides the dimensions of the window. It returns the current window width and height, and updates these values whenever the window is resized.

## Return Value

The hook returns an object containing two properties:

- `width`: `number` - The current width of the window.
- `height`: `number` - The current height of the window.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import useWindowDimensions from './useWindowDimensions';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const { width, height } = useWindowDimensions();

  return (
    <div>
      Window width: {width}px, height: {height}px
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the component displays the current window width and height. These values are updated in real-time as the window is resized.

## Implementation Details

- The hook initializes the `windowDimensions` state using the `getWindowDimensions` function.
- `getWindowDimensions` retrieves the current `innerWidth` and `innerHeight` of the window.
- The `useEffect` hook sets up an event listener on the window for the 'resize' event.
- The `handleResize` function within `useEffect` updates the `windowDimensions` state whenever the window sizeC changes.
- The event listener is cleaned up when the component is unmounted to prevent memory leaks.

## Notes

- This hook can be useful in responsive designs where the component behavior or layout depends on the window sizeC.
- The hook ensures performance efficiency by only re-rendering components when necessary (i.e., when the window sizeC changes).

This hook provides a simple and efficient way to access and respond to changes in the window's dimensions, making it a valuable tool in developing responsive web applications.
