# useActiveBreakpoint Hook

## Overview

The `useActiveBreakpoint` hook simplifies responsive design in your React applications by dynamically determining the current active breakpoint based on user-defined media queries. It allows you to easily adjust layouts, styles, or content based on the screen size, making your components adaptable to different devices.

## Importing the Hook

Begin by importing the hook into your component file:

```javascript
import { useActiveBreakpoint } from 'fui-fancyui';
```

## Usage

Here's how you utilize the hook in a functional component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useActiveBreakpoint } from 'fui-fancyui';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // Define your breakpoints (adjust these as needed)
  const breakpoints: Breakpoint[] = [
    { identifier: 'xs', query: '(max-width: 575.98px)' },
    { identifier: 'sm', query: '(min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767.98px)' },
    { identifier: 'md', query: '(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px)' },
    { identifier: 'lg', query: '(min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199.98px)' },
    { identifier: 'xl', query: '(min-width: 1200px)' }
  ];

  const activeBreakpoint = useActiveBreakpoint(breakpoints);

  return (
    <div>
      Current breakpoint: {activeBreakpoint || 'None'}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Breakpoints:** Create an array of `Breakpoint` objects, each specifying an identifier (e.g., 'sm', 'md') and a corresponding media query string.
2. **Call the Hook:** Pass your `breakpoints` array to the `useActiveBreakpoint` hook.
3. **Access Active Breakpoint:** The hook returns the identifier of the active breakpoint (e.g., 'md') or `null` if no breakpoint matches.

## Hook Definition

- **Purpose:** To determine the currently active breakpoint from the provided user-defined breakpoints.
- **Arguments:**
  - `breakpoints` (required): An array of `Breakpoint` objects, where each object has an `identifier` (string) and a `query` (string).
- **Return Value:**
  - The identifier (string) of the active breakpoint if a match is found.
  - `null` if none of the provided breakpoints match the current screen size.

**How It Works:**

- The hook uses `useState` to store the active breakpoint and `useEffect` to monitor window resize events.
- On resize, it evaluates the media queries you provided and updates the state with the matching breakpoint identifier.

## Important Considerations

- **Breakpoint Definition:** Carefully define your breakpoints to match your design requirements. Consider standard breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) or create custom ones.
- **Null Handling:** Always handle the case where `null` is returned (e.g., on initial render or when no breakpoints match).
